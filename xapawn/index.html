		<p>The red pieces are yours. They move like chess pawns (but not
			exactly): They can move one square forward to an empty square and they can capture diagonally. A player wins
			when one of their pieces advances to the other side of the board or the opponent is in a position with no
			possible moves. At the beginning of the game, you may also skip your move so that the computer moves first. There are no draws; One side will always win and the other will lose.</p>
		<p>The computer starts
			by making random moves and learns as you play. Whenever it loses (or runs into a "dead-end" situation), it adds
			the previous position to a list of positions to avoid, and won't make moves that lead to any positions on that
			list. The more the computer plays, the better it gets. Turn on pre-trained mode to play against a computer that
			already knows the best moves.</p>
