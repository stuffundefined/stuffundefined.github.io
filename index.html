    <h1>it ded?</h1>
    <p>not dead but im thinking about what to do</p>
    <ul>
      <li>I want some way for people to yell back at me - maybe an email address people can send things to and i manually post interesting comments i get (maybe with my replies)</li>
      <li>Still thinking about the layout, and how it should look on mobile devices as well</li>
      <li>I have thoughts in my head but writing them is hard</li>
      <li>Lots of school work and my non-schoolwork time, if it exists, is recovering from my tiredness</li>
      <li>I should move to a proper web host, not github pages</li>
      <li>happy new year</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>2 or 4 columns for different types of posts (Updates, thoughts, quotes, links)?</li>
      <li>some kind of format for storing posts and generating the list in real time, allowing for multiple views without too much manual work?
          <ul><li>script to post things, allowing things like automatic timestamp generation</li></ul>
      </li>
      <li>getting some kind of media or link embeds</li>
