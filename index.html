            <h1>Summer is getting closer</h1>
            <p>The main thing keeping me from treating this like a dignified website is that I want people to be able to give feedback. Probably just an email as I said but thats still a thing i need to set up. Also i have an education to get and im trying to not be burnt out<br>March and April are the most stressful time of year for me</p>

            <p>not dead but im thinking about what to do</p>
            <ul>
              <li>I want some way for people to yell back at me - maybe an email address people can send things to and i manually post interesting comments i get (maybe with my replies)</li>
              <li>Still thinking about the layout, and how it should look on mobile devices as well</li>
              <li>I have thoughts in my head but writing them is hard</li>
              <li>Lots of school work and my non-schoolwork time, if it exists, is recovering from my tiredness</li>
              <li>I should move to a proper web host, not github pages</li>
              <li>happy new year</li>
            </ul>
