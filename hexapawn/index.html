	<p style="margin: 20px auto 0; width: 500px ">The red pieces are yours. They move like chess pawns (but not
		exactly): They can move one square forward to an empty square and they can capture diagonally. A player wins
		when one of their pieces advances to the other side of the board or the opponent is in a position with no
		possible moves. There are no draws; One side will always win and the other will lose.</p>
	<p style="margin: 20px auto 0; width: 500px">The computer starts
	by making random moves and learns as you play. Whenever it loses (or runs into a "dead-end" situation), it adds
	the previous position to a list of positions to avoid, and won't make moves that lead to any positions on that
	list. The more the computer plays, the better it gets. Turn on pre-trained mode to play against a computer that
	already knows the best moves.</p>
	<p style="margin: 20px auto 0; width: 500px ">Before you start playing, can you figure out which side will win with optimal play?</p>
